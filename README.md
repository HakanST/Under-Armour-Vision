# Under-Armour-Vision

Scrapes web data from www.Underarmor.com without the use of any APIs or parsers. When a search is entered, the program will extract the search results data from the website. It then neatly displays all the items associated with that search along with the info (name, number, color availability, and type of wear). For example, if the search “blue shirt” is made, every shirt that is blue on the under armor website will be displayed. Each time a search is made, the search results are stored in to a hash table. As a result of this, offline searches can be made. Data is also stored in to a backup file for persistence so that if the program is terminated or unexpectedly shutdown (power outage, etc), the data from the previous sessions isn’t lost. A login system is also implemented, allowing you to log in as either a user or administrator. Users are only able to make searches and view data while administrators can add, modify, and delete item data from both the hash table and database. Additionally, administrators can view a transaction log. This displays every activity that involves any type of data modification (adding, editing, or deleting items).
